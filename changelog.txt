---------------

- Incorporated Lew's changes for reading simulated data files.
  new Programs SimCalculate reads the simulated data and returns a tree with the same structure as the data
- Cleaning up on CalHistograms.cc, for more readable code.
  All spectra now are generated with the Fill(specName,...) commands.
- Includes gamma ray tracking through GRETINA.

2.0, 2012-04-23
---------------

- possiblity to gate on XFP instead of OBJ
- time dependent corrections for OBJ, XFP, TACOBJ, TACXFP, CRDC Y, and IC
  script to generate correction factors: timecorrections.C
  script template to generate event numbers: evtnr.C
- corrections for constant shift of Y
- Gretina ATA and BTA corrections
- avoided gretina events of length 0
- run number correct
- fixed bugs in Doppler correction
- possibility to read simulated data
- ScalerAnalysis handles now many files
- new script to fit with mouse clicks, fitwindow.C
  usage:
  root [] .L fitwindow.C+
  root [] window()
  root [] xyz->Draw()
  now click with the middle mouse two or three markers.
  if two, the fit is done between the two, if three the middle marker is used as a start value for the peakposition.
  type "Fit()" in the shell, or just f while the mouse is still over the canvas
- Makefiles for Ubuntu and Mac provided
- data taken after Jan 2013 has a different type of scaler data. new version supports botht the old and the new type.
  
- Tracking:
  new classes for tracked data GretinaTrack.hh
  TrackSettings inherits from Settings, contain informtaion used for the tracking.
  Tracking class which does all the work, similar to Calibration and UnpackedEvent
  Track main program, makes tracked tree and some histograms
  including new doppler correction and new map calculation if desired

- available on request:
  addback for hodoscope
  delayed coincidence analysis software
  other stuff for the hodoscope, calibration, efficiency, simulations

1.2, 2012-12-13
---------------

All quantities are now in keV, mrad and mm
Support for Hodoscope, Galotte and OBJ PIN detectors
The scaler values read from the Global.dat file overflow at 24 bit, the values stored in the sc scaler tree are now corrected for overlfows 
New class "RunInfo", stores important information about the run, like detector efficiencies, lifetime and counters
RunInfo and Settings are written to the file
Calculate can split up the tree into one tree per cut, this allows for faster processing afterwards.
  new flags" "-c cutfilename -t TAC/TDC"
Standalone TreeSplitter program included, needs cuts, produces one tree per cut
Cal_histos can read individual trees. Usage with cuts still works as before
  new flag: "-tn treename" name of the tree to be analyzed. 
New addback type clustering, this clusters interaction points which have a maximum angle distance from each other
Fixed various small bugs

1.1, 2012-09-11
---------------

RawHistograms.cc and CalHistograms.cc modified to be more readable and more easily modified when adding new histograms.
Bundled GEB_HFC in with the current executables.
Implemented recalibration of mode 2 data on a crystal by crystal basis, in case the original calibrations were incorrect.
Added support of LaBr detectors in the S800 stream, as was added for the e11017 experiment.
GretinaCalc now has the time of the detection relative to the s800, as read from the card 29 data.
Slightly modified names of settings in the settings file, so that the effect of settings is more obvious from the name.
  Old names are still read if new names are not found, so that backwards compatibility of settings files is maintained.
PadCal now reads the names of spectra for use in CRDC calibration, rather than using hardcoded names of the outgoing cuts.
Cal_histos now checks to make sure that a settings file was given, prevented segfault otherwise.
