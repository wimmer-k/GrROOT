Documentation of GrROOT as of 2012-07-31

To check out the latest version of the use the following command.
This will make the folder "GrROOT" within the current directory and fill it with the latest version.

svn checkout svn+ssh://USERNAME@element/projects/gretina/GrROOT/svn/trunk/GrROOT

Alternatively, use tar to unpack the GrROOT tarball.

Once you have the GrROOT folder, use the following commands.

1. "./install.sh"
   This will make the env.sh script pointing to the current directory and perform first-time setup tasks.
2. "source env.sh"
   This must be run each time before the program is either run or compiled.
   This sets the PATH variable to include the appropriate bin directory, allowing for multiple
    versions to be modified and coexist on the same experimental account.
3. To compile, use "make" from within the "src" directory.



GrROOT:
  Purpose:
    Unpacks data.
    Additionally, if requested, writes out raw data,
                                creates histograms from raw data,
                                calibrates data,
                                writes out calibrated data,
                                creates histograms from raw data.
        
  Usage:
    GrROOT -i <inputfile> -o <outputfile> -s <settingsfile> <options>

    options:
      -rh:
         Write out the histograms from raw data.
         Note that in mode 2 data, calibrations are already applied in the decomposition,
              so the "raw" data is not completely raw.
      -rt:
         Write out the raw unpacked tree from data.
      -ch:
         Write out calibrated histograms.
      -ct:
         Write out the calibrated tree.

      -lb <int n>:
         Stop reading file after n buffers.
      -d <int n>:
         Print out current progress, write data to file after every n buffers.

  File Formats:
    
    Input:
      A file with buffers such as the output from the decomposition.
      Global.dat, GlobalRaw.dat, or the output from GEB_HFC.

      During event building, the program assumes that the buffers are in time order.
      It will continue, but complain, if timestamps are not in order.

    Output:
      A root file, containing histograms, data trees, or both, depending on the options passed.

      -rt
        A tree, gtr, with three branches:
          gretina
          s800
          mode3Event
        More information below on the format of these branches.
      -ct
        A tree, ctr, with three branches:
          gretinacalc
          s800calc
          mode3calc
        More information below on the format of these branches.
      -rh
        Various histograms related to the raw tree.
        These are defined in RawHistograms.cc
        These change frequently, so documentation would become outdated too often for documentation to be useful.
        To see what histograms are filled, with what, and when, please refer to RawHistograms.cc
      -ch
        Various histograms related to the calibrated tree.
        These are defined in CalHistograms.cc
        These change frequently, so documentation would become outdated too often for documentation to be useful.
        To see what histograms are filled, with what, and when, please refer to CalHistograms.cc





Histos:
  Purpose:
    From a raw tree, create histograms.

  Usage:
    Histos -i <inputfile> -o <outputfile> -s <settingsfile> <options>

    options:
      -n <int n>:
        Stop histogramming after n events have been read.
      -v <int v>:
        Set the verbosity level to v.
        Higher verbosity level prints out additional messages

      These are defined in RawHistograms.cc
      These change frequently, so documentation would become outdated too often for documentation to be useful.

  File Formats:
    Input:
      RawEventLoopBase expects as input the output of GrROOT when run with the -rt flag.

  In general, there are three data structures, each with a raw and calibrated version.
  The raw version aims to have only the data as read from the data file.
  The calibrated version aims to have only the information from which one extracts final information.

                         The remaining core traces are in positions 1-3 in ascending order.
      ftimestamp---------The timestamp as read from the GEB header.
      fits---------------The timestamp as read from the struct.

  The information about the calibrated s800 data.
  Parameters marked with a ? with be filled only if S800_DETAILED_TREE is set when compiling GrROOT.
  This is set in the Makefile.  (Make-clean, then make again for it to take effect.)
       NOTE: You will still be able to plot these parameters in root, but they will have bogus numbers.
